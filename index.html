                            In my free time I like to experience adventures with friends and learn new things.
                            This is not limited to one specific area and I'm always open to something new to venture.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Since my early childhood I am practicing judo.
                            Judo can be loosely translated as <i>"winning by yielding"</i>.
                            This means that to achieve your goals,
                            you have to study your opponent and try to use the force that the opponent invests against himself,
                            with a tiny bit of your own force to overcome your own weakness.
                            This was one of my first lessons that the use of
                            physical principles can make the difference.

                                <p class="text-intro">
                                In cases data are difficult to obtain, theories are available or statistical systems are observed, the study of Monte Carlo simulations can give evidence about certain circumstances.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                One application area for Monte Carlo simulations are extended air showers, which I investigated during my studies.
                                If a astrophysical particle hits the atmosphere, it can partitionate parts of it's primary energy into the production of secondaries particle over a stochastical process.
                                These secondaries particles can produce further particles if there energy is above a threshold.
                                A simulation of a cascade an primary electron could produce is shown in the corresponding picture.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Particle cascades in astophysical context can be simulated with the <a href="https://gitlab.ikp.kit.edu/AirShowerPhysics/corsika" target="_blank">CORSIKA</a> library.
                                It can be used to measure the signal a primary particle produce for different detection channels.
                                In my master thesis I implemented the first electromagnetic interaction model in CORSIKA's current version.
                                Therefore I used the lepton and photon propagator <a href="https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/PROPOSAL" target="_blank">PROPOSAL</a> to simulate the production of secondaries particle and implement a module which communicates with CORSIKA.

                                <!-- The size of the dots characterise the losen energy, decoded by a colour corresponding to an certain loss type. -->

                                If a data set exists, the task is to generate the maximum information content from it according to a problem definition.
                                It has to be taken into account that very large amounts of data have to be processed and an uncertainty on the statements has to be estimated.
                                Deep Learning offers a possibility to solve both problems in an appropriate way.
